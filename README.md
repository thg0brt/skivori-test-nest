## Use of ChatGPT as AI code editor/assistant.
 - Used it to help me fix some errors while installing Node on my computer. I used Chocolatey, but it wasn't properly installed.
 - Used it in error solving, such as the first deploy of the backend using Render, where I hadnâ€™t configured the Render web service properly.
 - Used it to help me enable imports and reading of .json files in the NestJS application.
 - Used it in the middleware to create a regex that allows only alphabetic characters and numerals in the 'search-games' method.
